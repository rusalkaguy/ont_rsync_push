# ont_rsync_push
Automatically rsync ONT sequencing data on a Mk1c or similar sequencing host to the HPC cluster

This repo is expected to be cloned into MK1C:/data/user-scripts

* [rsync_reads.sh](rsync_reads.sh) [--log LOGFILE [-v]] SRCDIR DESTDIR [rsync_flags] 
   * scans SRCDIR for sequencing runs, which are located by looking for "fast5_fail" directory. 
   * MD5 check sums are computed for all files, and a roll-up "md5sum" text file is created
   * The files are then rsync'ed to DESTDIR
      * the admin should create a public/private keypair, or add a password to .netrc to allow this
      * it is advisable to block non-rsync ssh commands on the source computer for this account.
   * if rsync succeeds, and "final_summary*.txt" exists, then "rsync.done" is created, and that sequencing directory will be skipped in the future
   * this script should be added to crontab using run-one (which may need to be installed ```apt install run-one```
      * run-one skips the next call, if the previous is still running (transfering data)
      * crontab entry 
```
# copy seq results to HPC cluster
0,30 * * * * run-one /data/user_scripts/rsync_reads.sh --log /data/user_scripts/rsync_reads.log /data USER@HOST:/TARGET_PATH
```
   * if ```--log``` is given, logs concise messags to that file (one line per directory rsync'ed)
      * -v increases the level of logging - adds SCAN, DONE, SKIP notifications



* [Makefile](Makefile)
   * target: "md5sum" 
      * computes .md5 files for sequencing and metadata files
      * creates roll-up "md5sum" 

# Thoughts pull vs push

If I had time to re-write this from scratch, I would change the paradigm and have the cluster pull from the sequencer, or a hybrid model that computes md5s on the sequencer, then a cluster-based pull process that pulls over all file with md5 sums. 

I find the pull approach superior because:  
* security: would be a much simpler, and more robust, security setup (the current script requires the minuit account to be able to rsync to my account on the cluster, which is done with a public/private key pair plus an ssh authorization script).
* email: it would allow the system to send email when a sequencing run is completely transferred, or if an problem was encountered, such as the sequencer going off line. It is not easy to send email from the sequencer, though Iâ€™m sure that could be set up, and would not work for reporting when the sequencer goes off-line.
